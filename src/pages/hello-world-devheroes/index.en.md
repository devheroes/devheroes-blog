Follow our journey to become development heroes. We will share here how this process is going. I believe that helping others is a very important way to grow as a developer, it strengthens what we already know and is beneficial for the whole community.

We will cover topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Elixir, and others.

My focus is currently on JavaScript. Needless to say, it is a requirement for any Front End developer to know at least the basics. The market today is geared towards libraries and frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular, etc. But I believe it is essential to have a solid base in JavaScript before going into them. At the beginning we will have many articles focused on JavaScript, but over time we will talk about these libraries and frameworks.

I won't be running the blog alone, other developers will share what they know here, so there will be articles on other areas of development, not just Front End.

We want to produce quality content, as well as that found on sites like CSS-Tricks, Scotch.io, SitePoint, Smashing Magazine, among others. As well as sharing our learning on subjects that may have already been addressed by other people, but showing how it was for us to learn them, with the difficulties and solutions we encountered.

Whenever possible, we will have videos of the topics being covered, so be sure to subscribe to the DevHeroes channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevheroesIo) (obs.: only in Portuguese).
